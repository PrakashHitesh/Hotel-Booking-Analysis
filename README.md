## Introduction

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether a hotel is likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

This project involves analyzing booking data from a city hotel and a resort hotel, including information such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, and special requests. All personally identifying information has been removed from the dataset.
Dataset

The dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, including the following features:

    Hotel type (City Hotel or Resort Hotel)
    Booking status (canceled or not)
    Lead time
    Arrival date (year, month, week number, day of month)
    Length of stay (weekend nights, week nights)
    Number of adults, children, and babies
    Meal type
    Country of origin
    Market segment
    Distribution channel
    Whether it is a repeated guest
    Booking dates and prices (ADR - Average Daily Rate)
    Number of special requests
    Reservation status and dates

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

    Python 3.10
  Set up the environment in IBM cloud.
  Drag and drop the dataset.

## Usage

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/PrakashHitesh/hotel-booking-analysis.git
cd hotel-booking-analysis

    Add your IBM Cloud Object Storage credentials in the script.

    Run the analysis script:

bash

python hotel_booking_analysis.py

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project includes various analyses, such as:

    * Monthly Booking Trends:
        Analysis of booking trends by month to identify peak periods.

    * Average Daily Rate (ADR) Analysis:
        Examination of the average daily rate by hotel type.

    * Special Requests Analysis:
        Distribution and frequency of special requests made by guests.

    * Correlation Matrix:
        Correlation analysis to understand relationships between numerical variables.

## Results

The analysis results are visualized through plots and charts, revealing key insights about booking trends, optimal booking times, pricing strategies, and customer behavior.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of hotel booking data provides valuable insights into booking patterns, pricing strategies, and customer preferences. These insights can help hotel management optimize their booking processes and enhance customer satisfaction.
Future Scope

## Future work may include:

    Predictive Modeling: Building machine learning models to predict booking cancellations and special requests.
    Advanced Analytics: Deeper analysis using more sophisticated statistical methods.
    Real-time Analytics: Implementing real-time data processing for up-to-date insights.
